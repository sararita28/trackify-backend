Trackify is an inventory tracking web application meant for logistics companies. It allows its users to :
<ul>
  <li><b>View items</b> that are currently in the inventory (as a list or individually)</li>
  <li><b>Edit</b> and <b>delete</b> items, <b>add comments to the deletes.</b> <b>Comments can then be edited, deleted or added</b> if there aren't any. </li>
  <li><b>Search</b> for items by ID, category, location.</li>
  <li>Users can also <b>view deleted items</b> (as a list or individually) <b>recover deleted items</b> or <b>permanently delete them.</b> </li>
  <li>Every item can be viewed individually and its listing will contain information about it such as its ID, category, location (such as a warehouse number), the number of units of that particular item that are currently available, as well as the item status (i.e. whether it's active/available or deleted).</li>
</ul>
